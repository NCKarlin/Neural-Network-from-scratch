# Neural-Network-from-scratch
This repository was instantiated to create a neural network (almost) from scratch and eliminating the use of third-party libraries to dig down deep into understanding the fundamentals and tuning of a deep learning neural network. 

## Disclaimer: Source
All of the code and comments are mainly based on the video tutorial series "Neural Networks from Scratch", which in turn is based on the book "Neural Networks from Scratch in Python â€“ Building neural networks in raw Python" by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukiela. (Links will be provided and linked in the future).

ADDITION: structure of the repo explanation, structue of each script explanation (theory, source, this script, etc.) -> Most of the theory in first file and additional theory along the way.
